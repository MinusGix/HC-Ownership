# HC-Ownership (Named: Villa)
A module for https://github.com/hack-chat/main which has these features:
ND stands for Not Done
 - Claim ownership of room
	- Allows claiming of room forcefully if you are of adequate rank. Aka, a Mod can claim a room from a normal user, and an Admin can claim a room from a Mod or normal user.
	- Allow creating 'roles'
		- (ND) allow you set a variety of permissions.
	- Allow Admin to claim room for all mods, and allow mods to claim a room for all mods. This allows anyone mod or admin to modify the rules, which they could already but this makes it more concrete.
	- (ND) Allow owner to have custom name colors for users with roles? (This would require a modification to the client, and is thus unlikely to happen.)
	- (ND) function to recycle channels if they haven't seen the owner in a certain period of time\=
